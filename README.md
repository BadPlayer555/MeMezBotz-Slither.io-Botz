# MeMezBotz-Slither.io-Botz
Slither.io bots coded in node JS working until this day JESUS CHRIST IT HAS BEEN a YEAR

# Note
The original user script has been lost. The script is this is a obfuscated one
Feel free to make yourself one

# Instruction
Thank you for using MeMez-Bots. Please do not rename, I spend two week to make this thing.

IMPORTANT:
- Refresh every day for both HTTP and socks.
- Use this http://textmechanic.com/text-tools/basic-text-tools/remove-duplicate-lines/ to remove duplicate lines so that the bots will be smoother.
- If you get banned, none of my business.
- This thing is buggy and don't spam in comments
- This isn't supported multi user interface so don't share server.
- This is based on TrapBots so don't blame me that I stealed because I don't know JS
